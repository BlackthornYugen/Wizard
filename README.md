# Wizard
## About
Wizard is a trick-taking card game for three to six players designed by Ken Fisher. It's a lot of fun so you should
definitely have a copy for when your friends or family visit. I have no plans to make any money from Ken Fishers
Intellectual Property and I do not feel my JS version would negativly effect sales of this great game. 

## Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:BlackthornYugen/Wizard.git
cd Wizard
npm install
npm start
```
